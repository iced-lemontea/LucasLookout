## About The Game

Uh oh! Little Lucas has just learned to crawl, and the whole house is his new playground! He's speedy, curious, and naturally drawn to interesting things... which aren't always safe.

**Lucas's Lookout** is a fast-paced, reaction-based game where you take on the vital role of Lucas's caregiver. Your mission is to keep him safe from everyday household hazards as he explores different rooms. Can you keep up with his adventures?

## Gameplay

The goal is simple but challenging: keep Lucas away from dangers!

1.  **Watch Lucas:** He crawls automatically across the screen.
2.  **Spot Hazards:** Dangers appear in his path. Pay close attention!
3.  **React Quickly:** Identify the hazard type:
    *   **Fixable Hazard?** (Outlet, coin, plastic bag, etc.) => **TAP THE HAZARD** itself to remove it.
    *   **Temporary Hazard?** (Kithen knife, clothes iron, etc.) => **TAP LUCAS** to distract him and make him change direction. (Watch out for the brief cooldown after tapping Lucas!)
4.  **Survive:** Keep Lucas safe for **20 seconds** in each level to win!

## Features

*   **5 Challenging Levels:** Guide Lucas safely through the Living Room, Kitchen, Nursery, Hallway and Bathroom.
*   **Varied Hazards:** Learn to handle both neutralizable and temporary dangers.
*   **Fast-Paced Action:** Test your reflexes and observation skills.
*   **Increasing Difficulty:** Lucas gets faster and hazards become more frequent!
*   **Educational:** Reinforces common baby safety awareness points in a fun way.
*   **Win Condition:** Complete all 5 levels to earn the "Ultimate Baby Proofer" title!
